Hi! We are in a new place!

This is an IDE named Intellij. 

By the time of this video we are on version: 

IntelliJ IDEA 2023.3.3 (Community Edition)

This makes our life easier.

I will proceed to create the roots of the clojure project.

All starts with a directory (folder interchangeably) and a deps.edn file like `~/my-app/deps.edn`

For now we added some values to a map, lets type a couple more definitions there:

:paths

After this key we add a vector [] containing a number of strings representing directories under the project root.

Remember our current root is:`/Users/victorinacio/4coders/typer`

So "src" "test" "resources" will be places where the code will be looked after.

This window shows some results of the current state of the deps.


So now let's code!!



See a small box on the corner. Detected that changes on the deps.edn happened and is waiting to react.

Let's click there: 

We started a clojure comand on the terminal.
